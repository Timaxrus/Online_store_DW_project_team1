## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose:
The purpose of this Data Warehouse project is to provide a structured and reliable framework for analyzing data from an online store. The system supports advanced analytics by organizing data into three distinct layers: **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**.

### Target Audience:
- **Technical Users**: Data Engineers, Database Administrators, and Developers.
- **Business Users**: Data Analysts, Business Intelligence Teams, and Decision-Makers.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Bronze Layer**: Load raw data from source CSV files with minimal transformations.
2. **Silver Layer**: Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to clean, validate, and enrich the data.
3. **Gold Layer**: Create analytical views for business intelligence purposes, such as sales performance, customer lifetime value, inventory status, and product review summaries.

## 2. Database Initialization Script

### Purpose:
This script initializes the database and sets up the necessary schemas (`bronze`, `silver`, `gold`) for the Data Warehouse.

### Code Snippet:
```sql
USE master;
GO

-- Drop and recreate the 'Team1' database
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'Team1')
BEGIN
    ALTER DATABASE Team1 SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
    DROP DATABASE Team1;
END;
GO

CREATE DATABASE Team1;
GO

USE Team1;
GO

-- Create Schemas
CREATE SCHEMA bronze;
GO

CREATE SCHEMA silver;
GO

CREATE SCHEMA gold;
GO
```

### **Warning** : Running this script will permanently delete all data in the Team1 database. Ensure proper backups before execution.

## 3. Bronze Layer

### Purpose:
The Bronze layer serves as the landing zone for raw data. It contains exact copies of the source tables without any transformations.

### Table Definitions:
DDL Script :
-  Creates tables for Customers, Products, Categories, Orders, Shipments, Inventories, and Reviews.
-  Each table mirrors the structure of the corresponding source CSV file.

**Example Table Definition:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE bronze.orders (
    OrderID      INT,
    ProductID    INT,
    CustomerID   INT,
    OrderDate    DATE,
    OrderQuantity INT,
    TotalAmount  DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Status       NVARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (Status IN ('Cancelled', 'Shipped', 'Delivered', 'Pending'))
);
```
---
### Bulk Insert Process:
1. **Script Name :** proc_load_bronze.sql
2. **Purpose :** Bulk inserts data from CSV files into the corresponding Bronze tables.
3. **Key Features :**
    - Automates the ingestion of raw data.
    - Ensures data integrity by matching column structures.

## 4. Silver Layer

### 1. Purpose:
The Silver layer performs ETL operations to transform and enhance the data from the Bronze layer. 
This ensures high-quality, standardized data for downstream analysis.

### Scripts:
### 1. Silver DDL :
    - Defines transformed tables with additional columns (e.g., Created_At).
    - Includes constraints, indexes, and relationships.
### 2. Silver Procedure :
    - Pulls data from the Bronze layer.
    - Applies transformations such as data cleaning, deduplication, and enrichment.
**Example Transformation Logic:**
The following snippet demonstrates how data is loaded and transformed in the Silver layer:
```sql
INSERT INTO silver.orders (
    OrderID,
    ProductID,
    CustomerID,
    OrderDate,
    OrderQuantity,
    TotalAmount,
    Status,
    CreatedAt
)
SELECT 
    OrderID,
    ProductID,
    CustomerID,
    OrderDate,
    OrderQuantity,
    TotalAmount,
    Status,
    GETDATE() AS CreatedAt
FROM bronze.orders
WHERE Status IN ('Pending', 'Shipped', 'Delivered');
```
### Stored Procedures:
### 1. PlaceOrder :
    * Inserts new orders into the silver.orders table.
    * Automatically generates unique OrderID values using an IDENTITY column or sequence.
### 2. UpdateInventory :
    * Updates inventory levels based on order and shipment data.
    * Ensures consistency between silver.inventory and silver.orders.
## 5. Gold Layer
### Purpose:
The Gold layer provides analytical views for business intelligence. These views aggregate and summarize data to support specific use cases.

### Views:
### 1. Dimension Tables :
* DimCustomers: Customer-related attributes.
* DimProducts: Product-related attributes.
* DimCategories: Category-related attributes.
### 2. Fact Views :
* SalesPerformance : Analyzes revenue, order quantities, and trends over time.
*  CustomerLifetimeValue : Calculates the total value contributed by each customer.
### 3. InventoryStatus : Tracks stock levels and identifies low-stock items.
* ProductReviewSummary : Aggregates product ratings and feedback.
  
### Example View:

``` sql
CREATE VIEW gold.SalesPerformance AS
SELECT 
    YEAR(OrderDate) AS Year,
    MONTH(OrderDate) AS Month,
    SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalRevenue,
    COUNT(OrderID) AS TotalOrders
FROM silver.orders
GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate);
```

## 6. Automation with SQL Agent
### Purpose:
Automate the entire ETL process to ensure timely and consistent data updates.

### Steps:
## 1. Schedule Jobs :
    * Use SQL Server Agent to schedule recurring jobs for:
    * Bulk inserting data into the Bronze layer.
    * Running ETL processes in the Silver layer.
    * Refreshing views in the Gold layer.
## 2. Job Configuration :
    * Define job steps for each layer.
    * Include error handling and logging to track job execution.
    
### Example Job:

``` sql
-- Create a SQL Agent Job for Bronze Layer Data Ingestion
EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_add_job @job_name = 'Bronze_Data_Ingestion';
EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_add_jobstep @job_name = 'Bronze_Data_Ingestion', 
    @step_name = 'Bulk_Insert', 
    @command = 'EXEC proc_load_bronze;';
EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_add_schedule @schedule_name = 'Daily_8AM', 
    @freq_type = 4, -- Daily
    @active_start_time = 080000;
EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_attach_schedule @job_name = 'Bronze_Data_Ingestion', 
    @schedule_name = 'Daily_8AM';
```
## 7. Deployment and Maintenance
### 1. Deployment Checklist:
    * Verify that all scripts are tested and error-free.
    * Ensure proper permissions for SQL Server Agent jobs.
    * Schedule regular backups of the Team1 database.
### 2. Maintenance Tasks:
    * Monitor job execution logs for errors.
    * Periodically review and optimize queries for performance.
    * Update transformations and views as business requirements evolve.
